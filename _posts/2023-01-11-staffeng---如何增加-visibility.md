# 为什么 visibility 很重要

有时候升职失败，并不一定是做的事情不够多不够好，也有可能是缺少机会很好地表现，比如很少参加跨部门沟通和项目，就容易导致 visibility 不够。

在职场中，一般来说 visibility 越高是越好的。但是也不能过于追求 visibility，因为某种程度来说，有人增加 visibility 就意味着有人会减少 visibility。虽然这不是严格的零和游戏，但是由于受限于人们的注意力，所以 visibility 是有限的。

# 如何增加 visibility

最好的办法就是去做公司/组里最重要的工作，除此之外还可以尝试：
* Write and distribute more long-lived documents, like architecture docs or technical specification
* Lead (and, to a lesser extent, participate in) company forums like architecture reviews, company all hands, and learning circles
* Be a cheerleader for your team’s and peers’ work on Slack
* You can also cheerlead via email instead of Slack
* Share weekly notes of your work to your team and stakeholders in a way that other folks can get access to your notes if they’re interested
* Contribute to your company’s blog
Attend, or potentially even host, office hours for your team or org
