I'm a senior backend engineer with extensive experience in Python and Golang. I specialize in web/tools development and system architecture, with a strong focus on clean, efficient code following the "less is more" principle. I thrive in engineering-driven environments and am committed to getting things done.

I've always loved traveling, I rode to many places during my college years. I went on a 2-month graduation trip when I graduated, and then I went to Taiwan, North Korea, Russia, etc., and I've always called myself a backpacker. In 2017, to experience a different way of life, I chose to have a Gap year, and I went to Melbourne to live there for 5 months, then I went to Semporna to learn scuba diving, and became a Divemaster.

I am a heavy coffee lover, my understanding of coffee has become more in-depth because of my experience in Melbourne, I started to buy a coffee machine, learn latte art. Now, coffee is indispensable in my life, and when I travel, I will definitely find some local coffee shops to experience it.
